        Once upon a time there was a hare who spent all day bragging about how
      fast he could run. Tired  hearing him boast, the tortoise, challenged
      him to a race. <span>“You must be kidding!”</span> said the hare laughing. <span>“I am so
        much faster than you.”</span><span>“We shall see,”</span>  the tortoise replied. The next day,
      the animals of the forest gathered to watch the race. Everyone wanted to
      see if the tortoise could beat the hare. The bear started the race yelling
      <span>“On you mark, get set, go!”</span> The hare immediately raced ahead, running
      faster than ever. He looked back and saw the tortoise was only a few steps
      away from the starting line. <span>“Foolish tortoise, ”</span> thought the hare.<span> “He is
      so slow. Why would he want to race me if he has no chance to win?”</span>
      Confident that he was going to win the race, the hare decided to stop in
      the middle of the road to rest under a tree. The cool and pleasant shade
      of the tree was very relaxing, so much so that the hare fell asleep.
      Meanwhile, the tortoise continued walking slowly, but steady. He was
      determined not to give up. Soon, he found the hare sleeping peacefully.
      The tortoise was winning the race! When the tortoise approached the finish
      line, all the animals in the forest began cheering with excitement. The
      noise woke the hare, who could not believe his eyes: the tortoise was
      crossing the finish line and he had lost the race.
